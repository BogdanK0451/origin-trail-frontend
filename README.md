# Ethereum Transaction Crawler

A web application that allows users to explore and visualize Ethereum blockchain transactions for any given wallet address. Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite for the frontend, with a backend service in Node (in another repo) that interfaces with Etherscan and Infura APIs.

## üåü Features

- View all transactions for any Ethereum wallet address from a specific block number
- Display transaction details including:
  - Sender and receiver addresses
  - ETH amounts transferred
  - Transaction timestamps
- Historical balance lookup by date

## üåê Public Access

The application is publicly accessible at:

- **Frontend**: [https://bogdank0451.github.io/origin-trail-frontend/](https://bogdank0451.github.io/origin-trail-frontend/)
- **Backend**: [https://backend-seven-iota-81.vercel.app/](https://backend-seven-iota-81.vercel.app/)

You can directly access the backend endpoints in your browser using the following examples. Replace the placeholder values with your desired Ethereum wallet address, block number, or date:

- **Transactions**: `https://backend-seven-iota-81.vercel.app/transactions/<wallet-address>/<start-block>?page=<page-number>&itemsPerPage=<items-per-page>`
  - Example: `https://backend-seven-iota-81.vercel.app/transactions/0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f/9000000?page=1&itemsPerPage=25`
  - `<wallet-address>`: The Ethereum wallet address (e.g., `0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f`).
  - `<start-block>`: The starting block number (e.g., `9000000`).
  - `<page-number>`: The page of results (e.g., `1`).
  - `<items-per-page>`: Number of transactions per page (e.g., `25`).

- **Balance**: `https://backend-seven-iota-81.vercel.app/balance/<wallet-address>/<date>`
  - Example: `https://backend-seven-iota-81.vercel.app/balance/0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f/2025-06-04`
  - `<wallet-address>`: The Ethereum wallet address (e.g., `0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f`).
  - `<date>`: The date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., `2025-06-04`).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of two main components:

### Frontend (This Repository)
- Vue 3 with Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vuetify 3 for Material Design components
- Vue Router for navigation
- Pinia for state management
- Vue I18n for internationalization
- Axios for API communication

### Backend (https://github.com/BogdanK0451/origin-trail-backend)
- Interfaces with Etherscan and Infura APIs
- Handles blockchain data fetching and processing
- Provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (this was made on v20.18.0)
- pnpm (should work with npm too but i haven't tried)
- Could be useful to set env variable on the system NODE_ENV=development, but theres an else branch in the code which should make the code behave as if we're in development mode incase it isn't set (so don't set it unless something doesn't work :) ) .

### Installation

1. Clone the repositories
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BogdanK0451/origin-trail-frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/BogdanK0451/origin-trail-backend.git
```

2. Install dependencies in both
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server (frontend)
```bash
pnpm dev
```
4. Start the development server (backend)
```bash
pnpm start
```


## üì± Usage

- On the transactions page
1. Enter an Ethereum wallet address in the search field
2. Specify the starting block number
3. Click "Search" to fetch and display transactions
4. Use the arrows to fetch new pages (too much data to be fetched at once)
- On the balance page
1. Enter an Ethereum wallet address in the search field
2. Pick a date for which you want to check the eth balance of the wallet address



## üõ°Ô∏è Development Tools

- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for git hooks
- Commitlint for commit message validation
- TypeScript for type checking

### Development Dependencies

## üîë API Keys

To use this application, you'll need API keys (but i've already set the values in code):

1. Etherscan API Key
   - Register at https://etherscan.io/apis
   - Create a new API key
   - Add it to the `.env.development` file in the backend repo

2. Infura API Key
   - Register at https://infura.io/
   - Create a new API key
   - Add it to the `.env.development` file in the backend repo



## Thoughts
- I initially encountered issues using the Etherscan API for historical balance checks via eth_getBalance. Although it should support this, it didn't work as expected so I switched to Infura, (first fetching the closest block to the user-specified date and time, ofcourse).
- I wasn't certain whether timezone accuracy was critical, so I simply used the user's local date and discarded the time portion.
- CORS issues arose on Vercel, so I allowed all origins, something I wouldn‚Äôt do in a production setting.
- API keys are currently exposed in the backend for speed and convenience, but this is obviously not best practice and wouldn't be acceptable in a real-world scenario.
- I skipped setting up linting and Husky/Commitlint on the backend to save time.
